JSR-236 (Java EE Concurrency)
=================
Overview
---------------
JSR-236 addresses the issue of threading in a java EE container.  According
to the docs from Oracle: "If a developer creates a new java.util.Thread object,
the java EE container could not guarantee that other Java EE platform services
would be part of this Thread."
